## Campus IT Support Ticket Portal

**Campus IT Support Ticket Portal** is a serverless helpdesk system designed for educational environments. It allows students and staff to submit IT support requests, track their processing status, and receive notifications when a ticket is created or updated.

The system also provides an administration interface for the IT support team. Administrators can receive, search, classify, update, add processing notes to, and delete tickets. Data displayed on the interface can be synchronized in real time without requiring the user to reload the page.

The project frontend is deployed using **AWS Amplify Hosting** at:

## 5. Guest Interface

Before authentication, users can view the system introduction and access the sign-in and registration functions.

The interface displays the support request form, issue-information fields, and guidance to help users provide sufficient information to the IT support team.

## 6. Authenticated User Interface

After successfully signing in through Amazon Cognito, the authenticated account information is displayed in the navigation bar.

Some form fields can be automatically populated using the authenticated user's information. Users can submit tickets, view previously submitted requests, and receive status updates without reloading the page.

## 7. Administrator Interface

The administrator page provides a dashboard containing an overview of the system, including:

- Total number of tickets.
- Number of tickets being processed.
- Number of high-priority tickets.
- Number of resolved tickets.

Administrators can search and filter tickets by status, priority, or issue category. They can also view ticket details, access attachments, update ticket statuses, and delete tickets.

Ticket data is retrieved from Amazon DynamoDB through Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
